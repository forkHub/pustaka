- Display helpful UI text

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Initialize the Environment**
```js
"use strict";
let brush;
console.log("test");
```
- `"use strict"` ensures cleaner JavaScript syntax.
- `brush` will hold the image used for drawing.
- `console.log("test")` confirms the script is running.

#### 2. **Start Function: Setup Canvas and Brush**
```js
function Start() {
  console.log("Start");
  Graphics(320, 240); // Create a canvas of 320x240 pixels
  brush = LoadImage("https://forkhub.github.io/basik/imgs/brush.png"); // Load brush image
  brush.handleX = 8; // Set brush anchor point (X)
  brush.handleY = 8; // Set brush anchor point (Y)
}
```
- `Graphics()` sets up the canvas.
- `LoadImage()` fetches the brush graphic.
- `handleX/Y` centers the brush for accurate placement.

#### 3. **Update Function: Draw on Mouse Drag**
```js
function Update() {
	if (MouseIsDown()) {
		brush.x = MouseX(); // Get current mouse X
		brush.y = MouseY(); // Get current mouse Y
		DrawImage(brush);   // Stamp brush at mouse position
	}
	Cls(0, 200, 320, 240); // Clear canvas with background color
	TextPos(0, 210);       // Set text position
	Write("Drag to draw"); // Display instruction
}
```
- `MouseIsDown()` checks if the mouse is pressed.
- `MouseX()` and `MouseY()` track cursor location.
- `DrawImage()` places the brush image.
- `Cls()` refreshes the canvas each frame.
- `Write()` gives user feedback.
