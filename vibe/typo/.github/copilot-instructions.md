# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This project explores and documents various algorithms for typo (spelling error) detection and correction in the Indonesian language, ranging from simple dictionary lookups to advanced AI models. The workspace is documentation-driven, with each file describing a different algorithm or approach.

## Key Files & Structure
- `readme.md`: High-level summary of all typo detection/correction approaches, ordered by complexity. Start here for conceptual orientation.
- `levenshtein distance.md`: Details and examples for the Levenshtein (edit distance) algorithm.
- `n-gram.md` and `n-gram aplikasi.md`: Concepts and practical applications of n-gram models for typo detection.
- `listrasi langkah.md`: Step-by-step workflows or algorithmic flows for typo correction.

## Patterns & Conventions
- Each algorithm/approach is documented in its own markdown file, with clear sections for how it works, pros/cons, and examples.
- The project is language-agnostic and focuses on algorithmic understanding, not code implementation.
- All documentation is in Indonesian, so AI agents should preserve language and terminology when updating or generating content.
- No build, test, or code execution workflows are present—this is a knowledge/documentation repository.

## Contribution Guidelines for AI Agents
- When adding new algorithms, create a new markdown file and update `readme.md` to include a summary and ordering.
- When updating existing documentation, maintain the structure: description, how it works, pros/cons, and examples.
- Use clear, concise language and provide practical examples relevant to typo detection in Indonesian.
- Do not introduce code unless specifically requested; focus on algorithmic explanation and comparison.
- Reference and cross-link related files where appropriate (e.g., link from `readme.md` to detailed algorithm files).

## Example: Adding a New Algorithm
1. Create `nama-algoritma.md` with sections: Deskripsi, Cara Kerja, Kelebihan, Kekurangan, Contoh.
2. Update `readme.md` to add a summary and place the algorithm in the correct order of complexity.
3. Ensure all documentation remains in Indonesian.

## Key Principle
This repository is a structured, comparative knowledge base for typo detection/correction algorithms—prioritize clarity, completeness, and Indonesian language fidelity in all contributions.
